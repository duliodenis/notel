# notel
notel is a hotel for your notes on iOS.

The features implemented in notel are of mutual benefit to users and developers. They help keep notel – and similar applications – fresh and interactive. They also create additional entry points into the application which will entice people to keep coming back.

### User Stories

The project's seven user stories are:

| Story        | Name           | Description  |

| 6      | Links | Data like email addresses, URLs, and, phone numbers to be tappable links within my notes. |
